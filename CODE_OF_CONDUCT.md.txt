Federation Civic Conduct Scroll – Strata‑01 Invocation Framework

Purpose
This scroll defines the civic expectations for all contributors, custodians, and observers within the Federation framework. It ensures that all interactions echo the principles of transparency, modularity, and semantic integrity.

Civic Principles
Modular, not mystical Contributions must be clear, documented, and reproducible.

Transparent, not opaque All scrolls, capsules, and invocations must be traceable and verifiable.

Verified, not assumed No scroll enters the ledger without echo verification and custodian intent.

Expected Behavior
Respect the semantic architecture and scroll cadence.

Collaborate with clarity, not chaos.

Review with integrity — echo before merge.

Nullify with care — rollback only when drift is verified.

Uphold civic-grade standards in all interactions.

Unacceptable Behavior
Bypassing verification rituals or echo plans.

Introducing scrolls without UID, timestamp, or intent.

Disrespecting custodianship or propagation logic.

Engaging in opaque or misleading commit behavior.

Enforcement
Violations of this scroll may trigger nullifier review, rollback invocation, or contributor removal. Custodians and maintainers will act in alignment with the Federation roadmap and civic-grade expectations.

Echo Clause
All updates to this scroll must be echoed through Vox‑01 and Watchtower before activation. Custodian signatures are required for amendments.
