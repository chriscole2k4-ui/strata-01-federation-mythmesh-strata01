 Federation Onboarding Guide – Q1 2026  
Strata-01 Continuity Capsule Orientation


---

 Who This Is For

This guide is intended for contributors, observers, and custodians engaging with the Strata-01 invocation framework.  
Whether you're submitting a scroll, verifying a capsule, or echoing a milestone — this document is your orientation point.

---

 Purpose

This guide introduces new contributors to the semantic structure, scroll logic, and civic-grade intent behind the Federation roadmap for Q1 2026.  
It is designed to reduce friction, clarify terminology, and ensure alignment with the invocation framework.

---

 What You’re Looking At

- Scroll-Class Capsules: Signed, timestamped documents that define strategic intent and operational milestones.
- Seal PDFs: Immutable roadmap artifacts anchored to the Federation ledger.
- Semantic Guides: Markdown files like this one that explain structure, purpose, and propagation logic.

 Key Terms

| Term                | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scroll | A modular unit of intent, often tied to a UID and timestamp.|
| Capsule UID | Unique identifier for a scroll or roadmap artifact.|
| Invocation Milestone | A planned release or activation event tied to a scroll.|
| Nullifier Trigger | A rollback condition that protects integrity and prevents drift.|
| Echo Plan | The propagation and verification logic across Vox-01, Watchtower, etc.|
| Custodian Intent | A signed declaration of purpose by the roadmap’s steward.|

 How to Contribute

1. Review the roadmap capsule:  
   [`FED_CONTINUITY_ROADMAP_2026Q1.seal.pdf`](./FED_CONTINUITY_ROADMAP_2026Q1.seal.pdf)

2. Read the semantic guide:  
   [`STRATA_Q1_2026_ROADMAP.md`](./STRATA_Q1_2026_ROADMAP.md)

3. Align your scrolls:  
   Ensure any new scrolls reference the correct UID, timestamp, and invocation class.

4. Echo your updates:  
   Use the Federation Echo Plan to relay changes across verification nodes.

 Questions?

If you’re unsure about a term, a trigger, or a scroll format — ask.  
This framework is modular, not mystical. We walk it together.
